I want to build crm application with UI base on neo-brutalism 
Design a clean yet edgy Neo-Brutalist web UI for a notification and file management. The layout should be based on an asymmetrical grid with clear visual dividers. Use a vibrant accent color (e.g., neon green or electric blue) on a muted background (e.g., beige or concrete gray). The typography should feature a bold, geometric sans-serif font for headlines and a more legible sans-serif for body text. The interface should include several prominent components: a task list with checkbox interactions, a client profile card with distinct borders and shadows, and a blocky data visualization graph. Website ensure responsive supported all size windows. I want to use techstack Qwik / Qwik City, sqlx, Rust/WASM file viewer. I want to choose the best and fast technology for develop this system
